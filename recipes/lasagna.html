    <h1>Lasagna recipe</h1>

    <p>Lasagna is a once-a-year project for me. I love it deeply, but it's rare that I can carve out time for it. 
        When it does happen, it's in the dead of winter when I have absolutely nothing else to do but spend the entire day in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>While it's impossible to beat the classic version — with a homemade ragu and, when I can manage it, homemade pasta — 
        I'm all about an easier version that makes lasagna a much more frequent occurrence. 
        This recipe is exactly that. This lasagna is about as low-lift as you can get while still achieving cheesy, crowd-pleasing results.</p>
        <h2>Ingedients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups), such as Rao's or Newman's Own</li>
            <li>12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 3 cups), divided</li>
            <li>15 dry lasagna noodles (not no-boil, about 2/3 of a 1-pound box), divided</li>
            <li>15 to 16 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese (about 2 cups), divided</li>
        </ul>
