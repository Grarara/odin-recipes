    <h1>Tomato pasta recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/tomato_pasta.jpeg" alt="Image of Tomato pasta">
    <p>There's a common theme to the pasta recipes you'll find on repeat in my weeknight dinner rotation: 
        They all require a minimal amount of effort, call for no more than a handful of basic ingredients, 
        and involve mostly hands-off cooking. But they still result in a totally comforting dinner that my whole family devours.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, this creamy tomato rigatoni pasta dish is going to leave you feeling like a total dinner rockstar. 
        In about 30 minutes, you'll have a pot of perfectly cooked pasta with the most incredible homemade creamy tomato sauce.
         Even on the nights I feel like I just can't with dinner, this is still totally doable because the sauce comes together 
         with canned tomatoes, cream, pasta water, and mostly hands-off cooking. </p>
        <h2>Ingedients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 pound dried rigatoni pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add 1 small diced yellow onion 
                and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 1/2 teaspoons 
                kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes if using. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook,
                 stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the pasta.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1 pound dried rigatoni pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package 
                instructions for al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Drain the rigatoni.</li>
            <li>Return the sauce to medium heat. Stir in 1/2 cup heavy cream and the reserved pasta water and bring to a simmer. 
                Gently stir in the pasta until well-coated. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley leaves if desired.</li>
