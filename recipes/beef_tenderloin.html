    <h1>Beef Tenderloin recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/beef_tenderloin.jpeg" alt="Image of Beef Tenderloin">
    <p>A perfectly cooked beef tenderloin is truly a sight to behold. 
        The delectable cut often made special-occasion appearances when I was growing up, 
        but Easter Sunday and its rosy-hued tenderloin tea sandwiches was always a holiday favorite.</p>
    <p>After early church and egg hunts in our finest spring whites, my family would race home to enjoy my mother's fabulous Southern spread. 
        All of our favorite mainstays were there — think buttery deviled eggs and pickled Sea Island shrimp — but her signature beef 
        tenderloin sliders were the ultimate pièce de résistance.</p>
        <h2>Ingedients</h2>
        <h3>For the beef tenderloin:</h3>

            <li>1 to 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the horseradish sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise, store-bought or homemade</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole or 2% milk</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the sliders:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dinner rolls, such as Parker House</li>
            <li>Baby spinach or arugula</li>
            <li>Whole grain mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove 1 (2 1/2 to 3 pound) beef tenderloin from the refrigerator at least one hour before cooking.
                Trim any fat and silver skin from the beef and discard.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F. Tie the roast in 1 1/2-inch intervals if necessary and place in a large roasting pan. 
                Season with 2 to 3 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 to 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper. 
                Cook the beef for 15 minutes. Pour the butter over the beef and continue roasting until it reaches an internal 
                temperature of 130°F for medium rare, 25 to 30 minutes. (The temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees while resting.)
            </li>
            <li>Allow the meat to cool to room temperature, then wrap in foil and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. 
                Cut into very thin slices for sliders.</li>
            <li>For the horseradish sauce, combine 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, and 2 tablespoons whole 
                or 2% milk until desired consistency is reached. Season with more black pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve sliced beef with dinner rolls, baby spinach or arugula, and horseradish sauce.</li>

        </ol>
